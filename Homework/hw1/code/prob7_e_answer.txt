awk '{print $1}' roster_sort_lastName_noDuplicate.txt | grep 'C\|D' -c

4

side note - if I dont include -c at the end then the output will be the 4  lastt names, 2 of which start with C, and the other two start with D

NOTE - Below is my final version of this problem. I was able to use only the grep call to make it work instead of using both awk and grep.

grep -c "^C\|^D" roster_sort_lastName_noDuplicate.txt
